new on-demand tour booking for city newcomers


This is on-demand tour application for city travellers either local or foreigners. 
The application is dedicated to give proper guidelines at any city regarding do's and don'ts, best place to experience culture and so on.
The idea is to give city tour to anyone that want to visit multiple place in the city either by drafting plan
or choosing existing package and checking available tour guider. The price is ultimate competitive advantage..it is charged per trip instead
of per person with tour guider must be flexible on schedule. 

We have multiple activity and mostly rely on fragment and intent to boost performance 
Initially, we going to use Firebase as our backend including authentication, notification, 
We use geofire for location-based function
We actually use AWS EC2 for VPS and S3 to store data storage
We going to use MySql soon in beta testing for caching data and storing in main database using NoSQL
Caching are done using redis, cassandra and Varnish will be used for performance accelerator
